# FFXIV dungeon item lists
These lists are generated by parsing the official Eorzea Database dungeon pages ([example](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/98319325b98/)) and using [xivapi](https://xivapi.com/) to include only equippable items (no minions, orchestrion rolls, materia, etc.)

You can find the results organized by expansion in the [output](output) directory.

If you want to run this yourself, set env var `XIVAPI_KEY` to [your xivapi key](https://xivapi.com/account) ([docs](https://xivapi.com/docs)). [requests-cache](https://pypi.org/project/requests-cache/) is used because this data is not expected to change often, and we can be kind to SQEX and XIVAPI servers.
